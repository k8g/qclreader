flow cycometery cells per ? 

targest cells that leave the "domrancy phase"

Can cause resistant clones maybe not clear to know that.

32.5 vs 21 month continous vs 2 year theraphy. but no data on quality of life.
adjusted does and came of when revalamid became too much.

2/3rds of people under-reported symptoms.

still don't know about dosing. looked at dosing (5 to 15 mg) not showing dose response. 

Did the dose  affect secondary cancer risk?

mayo study dex on demand. 80% of people who got rev alone needed dex during induction.

for diahreea
bile salt binder (gall blader problems) 
low fat diet.  

kumar et al ash 20154 abs 82
contining ixazomib improved response.

diarrhea, nausea, pain in exremeties mainly at start of treatment
durable response over 2 yrs.
reduced neuropathy. 

severe neuropathy is an exlusion critera for almost all clinical trials.

CD40 CD138, CD38, SLAMF7 or surface protein 1 targets for antibodies

create an antibody to allow the body to recognize the cell as foreign.
complementery protein attack. destroy cell membranes.
attack myeloma cell biology. just blocking receptors

penabinistat for maintancce.

need clinical trials for maintanance therepy.

nov 2013 mm diagnosis re-do.

need to look at risk stratificaiton.

T cell used in trial as consolidation after transplant viral theraphy
mayo trial with measles vacines did not work out as it should with high dose.

clonoal typing. at diagnosis about 4 to 6 different clones. With sequencing to determine lonal types. the 
relapse is with types that is not suppress. Try to clonally suppress all clones. 
looks like relapse is clones escaping from control.
